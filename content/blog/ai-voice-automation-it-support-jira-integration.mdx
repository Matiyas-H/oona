# How Voice AI Transformed 24/7 IT Support Into a Fast, Frictionless Experience

Always-on technology means always-on responsibility.
But traditional phone-based IT support has a breaking point.

When critical systems fail outside office hours, engineers must wake up to answer calls — even when the caller only needs help logging a ticket.
Meanwhile, callers sit in queues waiting for someone to pick up the phone.

This creates stress on both sides:

- Lost time for engineers
- Lost trust for users
- Lost revenue during incidents

There had to be a better way.

## A New Standard for IT Support

One major Nordic tech organization decided to redesign how urgent phone support works.

Their goal was simple:

If someone needs help, they should get it right now, without waking half the engineering team.

Omnia-Voice delivered a Conversational AI support line that:

- Answers every call instantly
- Speaks naturally (English + Finnish)
- Understands the issue and urgency
- Logs all required details
- Automatically creates a structured Jira ticket
- Alerts humans only when needed

No human has to answer the phone.  
No critical detail gets lost.  
No caller waits.

## What The Caller Experiences

Instead of queuing or explaining a problem multiple times, the caller dials the same familiar support number.

They are greeted by a natural service experience:

“Hi — how can I help you today?”

The voice assistant:

- Listens and understands the issue
- Asks clarifying questions
- Confirms urgency
- Logs the case into the existing ITSM (Jira)
- Communicates next steps
- Ends the call politely

Everything a human agent would do — but faster, and always available.


## A Better Experience for Humans on Both Sides

### For users:
- Zero wait times
- Natural conversation
- No complex menus
- Clear expectations

### For engineers:
- Only real incidents reach them
- No unnecessary wake-ups
- Structured tickets every time
- Faster triage and quicker resolution

Engineers now work on problems — not phone calls.


## Designed for High-Stakes Environments

IT operations never slow down. This automation doesn’t either.

- Handles large call bursts during outages
- Provides bilingual support (Finnish and English)
- Captures required data for proper escalation
- Built-in guardrails prevent off-topic requests
- Works across production, staging, and development environments
- Complies with GDPR and utilizes secure voice pipelines

Reliability that scales automatically.


## Why It Matters

When automation becomes the first line of support:

- Support delivery becomes cost-efficient
- SLAs improve through faster escalation
- Engineers maintain work-life balance
- Availability and uptime increase
- No important call is missed during critical moments

This is not about replacing people — it is about removing friction.


## Strategic Value for IT Leaders

- Increased operational resilience without additional staffing
- Eliminated bottlenecks during peak incidents
- Better user experience during stressful events
- Measurable ROI from the very first day
- A scalable platform for ongoing digitization

This becomes a competitive strength — not just a support upgrade.


## Modernize Your Support Line

If your organization:

- Operates mission-critical systems
- Uses phone calls for incident reporting
- Relies on on-call engineering teams
- Needs faster resolution and reduced stress
- Works with Jira or similar ticketing systems

Voice automation will deliver immediate value.
