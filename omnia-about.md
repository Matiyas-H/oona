REAL-TIME VOICE AI INFRASTRUCTURE BUILT ON AN AUDIO-NATIVE LLM ARCHITECTURE.
The Promise and The Problem
Voice is the most natural interface — but current systems chain three models
together, losing speed and realism.
We built an audio-native LLM architecture that speaks and listens like a person — in
real time.
Problem:
Voice AI Is Built on Rented APIs
Voice AI today is stitched together from three separate vendors — speech recognition, language models,
and voice synthesis
500–1000 ms latency (cascade bottleneck)
Rate limits + fragility (three points of failure, capped scalability)
Permanent vendor margins (costs stay high even at scale)
Limited control (locked to vendor capabilities and roadmaps)
Recent advances like AudioLM and SeamlessM4T showed what’s possible. Omnia Voice takes the
next step — translating those research insights into a production.
Problem:
Voice AI Is Built on Rented APIs
Even OpenAI Realtime doesn’t solve this — you’
re locked to their models, their infrastructure,
and their pricing. You can’t bring your own models, self-host for compliance, or control
infrastructure costs at scale.
Scaling on rented APIs isn’t impossible — but it’s permanently uneconomic and performance capped.
The bigger you scale, the worse the economics get — until you own the stack.

Solution:
The Owned Stack for Real-Time Voice AI
What we built:
Omnia Voice builds on recent open research and open-weight LLMs to make real-time, low-latency
voice AI practical for production.
Our architecture connects audio directly to the LLM through a lightweight multimodal projection layer and
includes integrated GPU-optimized TTS — delivering natural, human-speed conversations without relying
on external STT or orchestration APIs.
The platform is live through an API and no-code workspace, enabling developers and enterprises to deploy
secure, multilingual voice agents in minutes — on cloud or on-prem.
Solution:
Audio-Native Voice AI Infrastructure
What this delivers:
250 ms latency — up to 5× faster than cascade architectures
Native multilingual support
Deployment flexibility — cloud, self-hosted, or white-label
C
ompliance-ready architecture for regulated industries
Why it works:
Traditional voice AI chains three vendors together.
Omnia Voice unifies these stages into a single architecture where audio connects directly to the LLM.
The result: faster, multilingual, and cost-efficient voice AI that customers can fully control.
